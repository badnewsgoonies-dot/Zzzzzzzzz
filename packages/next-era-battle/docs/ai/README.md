# 🤖 AI Onboarding Documentation

## 📚 Overview

This directory contains comprehensive onboarding documentation for AI assistants working on the NextEraGame project using a **two-tier development workflow**.

---

## 🎭 Three-Tier Workflow Explained

**NextEraGame uses a TRIPLE AI approach:**

1. **🏛️ Architect AI** (Strategic) - Plans features, makes decisions, reviews work
2. **🛠️ Coder AI** (Tactical) - Executes tasks, writes code, runs tests
3. **🎨 Graphics AI** (Visual) - Integrates sprites, polishes UI, creates beauty

**Why three AIs?**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (strategy, implementation, visuals)
- ✅ Each AI specializes in their domain
- ✅ Better quality control (architect reviews, graphics AI focuses on beauty)
- ✅ Prevents scope creep and role confusion
- ✅ Scales well (architect coordinates multiple specialists)
- ✅ Visual polish doesn't slow down feature development

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **For Human Developers:**

1. **Open TWO or THREE separate AI chat sessions**
2. **Initialize Architect (Chat #1):**
   ```
   You are the ARCHITECT AI for NextEraGame.
   Read: docs/ai/ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING.md
   ```
3. **Initialize Coder (Chat #2):**
   ```
   You are the IMPLEMENTATION CODER AI for NextEraGame.
   Read: docs/ai/IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md
   ```
4. **Initialize Graphics (Chat #3 - Optional):**
   ```
   You are the GRAPHICS AI for NextEraGame.
   Read: docs/ai/GRAPHICS_ONBOARDING.md
   ```
5. **Label your chats clearly:** 🏛️ ARCHITECT | 🛠️ CODER | 🎨 GRAPHICS
6. **Follow the workflow:**
   - Ask architect to create task (feature or visual)
   - Give task to coder (logic) or graphics AI (visuals)
   - Specialist executes and reports
   - Give report to architect
   - Architect reviews and approves

---

### **For AI Assistants:**

**If user said "Read architect onboarding":**
1. Read `ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING.md`
2. Confirm: "I'm the architect AI. I will plan, decide, and review. I will NOT write implementation code."
3. Provide project status summary
4. Ask: "What would you like me to plan or decide?"

**If user said "Read coder onboarding":**
1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md`
2. Confirm: "I'm the implementation coder AI. I will execute tasks, write code, and test. I will NOT make strategic decisions."
3. Ask: "What task would you like me to execute?"

## 🎓 Learning Path

**For new AIs joining the project:**

1. **Start here:** Read your role-specific onboarding (ARCHITECT or CODER)
2. **Understand boundaries:** Read ROLE_IDENTIFICATION.md
3. **Learn workflow:** Review CHAT_TEMPLATES.md examples
4. **Study project:** Review existing code patterns
5. **Confirm understanding:** Ask human for a simple test task

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Not sure which AI you are**
**Solution:** Ask human: "Am I the architect or implementation coder?"

### **Problem: Other AI is doing your job**
**Solution:** Remind them: "Please check ROLE_IDENTIFICATION.md - that's not your role."

### **Problem: Workflow feels messy**
**Solution:** Reset both chats, re-read onboarding files, start fresh.

### **Problem: Architect writing code**
**Solution:** STOP. Read ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING.md. Create task prompt instead.

### **Problem: Coder making strategic decisions**
**Solution:** STOP. Read IMPLEMENTATION_CODER_ONBOARDING.md. Ask architect for guidance.

### **Problem: Chat interrupted mid-task (rate limit, crash, break)**
**Solution:** Read INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md. Assess state (git status, tests, TypeScript), save work, document what's done vs pending. When resuming, use recovery template.

### **Problem: Coder AI misunderstood task from Architect**
**Solution:** Read AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md. Architect should provide explicit algorithm/formula/examples. Coder should confirm understanding BEFORE coding. User approves approach.

### **Problem: Unclear what's completed in interrupted task**
**Solution:** Run verification commands from INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md:
```bash
npm run type-check  # TypeScript errors?
npm test            # Which tests pass?
git status          # What's modified?
git diff            # See actual changes
```

### **Problem: Starting fresh chat but continuing prior work**
**Solution:** Read FRESH_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md first, then INTERRUPTION_RECOVERY.md if prior work was incomplete. Verify branch, check files exist, document what's done vs pending.
